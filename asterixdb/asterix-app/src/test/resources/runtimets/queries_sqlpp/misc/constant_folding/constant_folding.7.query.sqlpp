 * Description: No constant folding of OR with a non functional argument
 *
 * Update/note: this should be folded as the non functional argument would short-circuited in runtime. Due to
 * ASTERIXDB-3103, the constant folding rule doesn't see a non functional argument, but a variable. Hence,
 * the expression 'get_year(current_date()) < x' is eliminated
