 *  Description     : Full-text search index test
 *                  : This test is intended to verify that the full-text search works as expected.
 *                  : query #3 - two string values in [an ordered list] query with "any" option
 *                  :            in this case, "any" option that enforces a disjunctive search will be applied.
 *  Expected Result : Success
