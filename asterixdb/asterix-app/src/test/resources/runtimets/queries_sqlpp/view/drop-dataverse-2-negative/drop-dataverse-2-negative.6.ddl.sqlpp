--- Test that DROP DATAVERSE fails due to cross-dataverse dependencies

--- View depends on datatype

drop dataverse test1 if exists;
create dataverse test1;

drop dataverse test2 if exists;
create dataverse test2;

create type test2.t1 as closed { r:int64? };

create view test1.v1(test2.t1) default null as select r from range(1,2) r;

drop dataverse test2;
