--- Test that DROP DATAVERSE fails due to cross-dataverse dependencies

--- View depends on synonym

drop dataverse test1 if exists;
create dataverse test1;

drop dataverse test2 if exists;
create dataverse test2;

create dataset test2.ds2(c1 bigint not unknown, c2 bigint) primary key c1;

create synonym test2.s3 for ds2;

create view test1.v1 as select s3.* from test2.s3;

drop dataverse test2;
