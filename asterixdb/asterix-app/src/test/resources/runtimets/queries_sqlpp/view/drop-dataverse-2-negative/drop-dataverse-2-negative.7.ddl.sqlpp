--- Test that DROP DATAVERSE fails due to cross-dataverse dependencies

--- View refers to another view view foreign key declaration

drop dataverse test1 if exists;
create dataverse test1;

drop dataverse test2 if exists;
create dataverse test2;

create dataset test2.employee_2(e_id int not unknown, e_name string, e_mgr_id int, e_hrr_id int)
  primary key e_id;

create view test2.employee_v2(e_id int not unknown, e_mgr_id int)
  default null
  primary key (e_id) not enforced
  as employee_2;

create dataset test1.employee_1(e_id int not unknown, e_name string, e_mgr_id int, e_hrr_id int)
  primary key e_id;

create view test1.employee_v1(e_id int not unknown, e_mgr_id int, e_hrr_id int)
  default null
  primary key (e_id) not enforced
  foreign key (e_mgr_id) references test2.employee_v2 not enforced
  as employee_1;

drop dataverse test2;
