 *  Description     : Secondary full-text index index-only selection plan verification test
 *                  : The test is intended to verify that the secondary RTree index is used in the optimized query plan.
 *                  : In this plan, we have multiple conditions that one index can cover.
 *                  : Thus, index-only plan is not possible.
 *  Expected Result : Success
