This example sets up a very basic Hyracks cluster to be used for counting words in a file with the textclient example.
To run, simply execute:

        bin/hyrackscc -config-file conf/text.conf

to start the cluster controller. Once this process is running, execute:

        bin/hyracksnc -config-file conf/text.conf

and you will have a Hyracks cluster running locally for the textclient to use.
