This package holds a very simple Hyracks client program that counts the words in a supplied text file. A prerequisite
is a running Hyracks cluster from the textserver example.

In the bin directory of the unzipped textclient package, run

        textclient -host localhost \
         -infile-splits textserver-nc1:data/file1.txt \
         -outfile-splits textserver-nc1:data/file1.txt.out \
         -algo -hash
